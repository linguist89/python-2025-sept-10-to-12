# Session 3: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice getting input from users:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple greeting program. How would you get the user's name and say hello to them?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's name and then prints a personalized greeting. Try running it and entering different names to make sure it works.

2. **Question:** What happens when you try to do math with user input without converting it to a number?

   **Self-Check:** Try this code:
   ```python
   age = input("Enter your age: ")
   next_year = age + 1
   print(f"Next year you'll be {next_year}")
   ```
   What happens? How would you fix it?

3. **Question:** You're making a simple calculator. How would you get two numbers from the user and add them together?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for two numbers, converts them to integers, adds them, and prints the result. Try it with different numbers to make sure it works.

4. **Question:** How would you make your program more user-friendly by giving clear instructions?

   **Self-Check:** Compare these two prompts:
   ```python
   # Version 1
   name = input("Name: ")
   
   # Version 2
   name = input("Please enter your full name: ")
   ```
   Which one is clearer? Try both and see which gives better results.

5. **Question:** You're making a simple survey. How would you ask for someone's favorite color and then use that information?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's favorite color and then prints a message like "Your favorite color is blue!" Try it with different colors to make sure it works correctly.
