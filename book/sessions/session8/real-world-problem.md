# Real-World Problem: Personal Finance Calculator

## The Scenario

You're building a personal finance application for a friend who wants to track their monthly expenses and savings. They need a simple calculator that can:

1. Calculate monthly savings based on income and expenses
2. Determine how long it will take to reach a savings goal
3. Calculate the percentage of income saved each month

## The Challenge

Your friend has been doing these calculations manually with a calculator, which is:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Not easily repeatable for different scenarios

They want a simple program that can handle these calculations quickly and accurately.

## Real-World Context

This is a common problem in personal finance applications like:
- Budgeting apps (Mint, YNAB)
- Investment calculators
- Retirement planning tools
- Expense tracking applications

## Sample Data

Let's work with this example:
- Monthly income: $4,000
- Monthly expenses: $3,200
- Savings goal: $10,000

## Expected Results

- Monthly savings: $800
- Savings rate: 20%
- Time to reach goal: 12.5 months

## Why This Matters

Understanding how to break down real-world problems into functions is crucial for:
- Building useful applications
- Solving complex problems systematically
- Creating reusable code components
- Developing computational thinking skills

## Next Steps

In the guided function creation section, we'll build these functions step by step, learning how to:
- Design function interfaces
- Handle different data types
- Make functions flexible and reusable
- Test our functions with real data
