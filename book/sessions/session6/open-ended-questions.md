# Session 6: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice creating and using functions:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple calculator. How would you create a function to add two numbers?

   **Self-Check:** Write a function called `add_numbers` that takes two parameters and returns their sum. Test it with different numbers like 5 and 3, or 10 and 20. Make sure it returns the correct answer.

2. **Question:** You want to create a function that greets someone by name. How would you do this?

   **Self-Check:** Write a function called `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, [name]!" Test it with different names like "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie".

3. **Question:** You're making a simple tip calculator. How would you create a function that calculates a 20% tip?

   **Self-Check:** Write a function called `calculate_tip` that takes a bill amount and returns the tip amount. Test it with different bill amounts like $25, $50, and $100. Make sure the math is correct.

4. **Question:** What's the difference between a function that prints something and a function that returns something?

   **Self-Check:** Create two functions:
   - One that prints "Hello" and returns nothing
   - One that returns "Hello" but doesn't print anything
   
   Try using both functions and see what happens. Which one is more useful?

5. **Question:** You're making a simple grade calculator. How would you create a function that converts a percentage to a letter grade?

   **Self-Check:** Write a function that takes a percentage score and returns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Test it with different scores like 95, 85, 75, 65, and 55. Make sure it returns the correct letter grade for each score.
