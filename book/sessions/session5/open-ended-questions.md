# Session 5: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice using loops:

1. **Question:** You want to print the numbers 1 through 5. How would you use a for loop to do this?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that uses a for loop to print numbers 1 through 5. Then try changing it to print numbers 1 through 10. Make sure each number appears on a separate line.

2. **Question:** You're making a simple counter. How would you use a while loop to count from 1 to 5?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that uses a while loop to count from 1 to 5. Make sure you increment the counter inside the loop, or it will run forever! Try it and see what happens if you forget to increment the counter.

3. **Question:** You want to print "Hello" 3 times. How would you do this with a loop?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that prints "Hello" exactly 3 times using a loop. Try using both a for loop and a while loop to see which one you prefer.

4. **Question:** What's the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

   **Self-Check:** Write the same program using both types of loops. For example, count from 1 to 5 using both a for loop and a while loop. Which one is easier to understand? Which one is less likely to have bugs?

5. **Question:** You're making a simple guessing game. How would you use a loop to let the user guess up to 3 times?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks the user to guess a number (like 7). Give them up to 3 chances to guess correctly. Use a loop to repeat the guessing process. If they guess correctly, tell them they won. If they use all 3 guesses, tell them they lost.
