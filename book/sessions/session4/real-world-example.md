# Session 4: Real-World ExampleWhy Making Decisions Matters

Imagine you're building a simple age verification system for a website. You need to check if someone is old enough to access certain content. This is a perfect example of using conditionals (if statements) to make decisions.

**The problem with not checking conditions:**
```python
# What if we don't check the age?
age = 15
print("Welcome to our website!")
# This would let anyone in, even kids who shouldn't be there
```

**Real example:** In 2018-2019, Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes had a software problem. The plane's computer was supposed to help prevent crashes, but it had a bug in its decision-making logic. When one sensor gave bad information, the computer made the wrong decision and caused the plane to crash, killing hundreds of people. This happened because the software didn't properly check all the conditions before making decisions.

**The programming lesson:**
This shows why it's important to:
- Always check all the conditions before making decisions
- Have backup plans when things go wrong
- Test your decision-making logic thoroughly
- Make sure your conditions cover all possible situations

**Key takeaways:**
- Always use if statements to check conditions before acting
- Think about what could go wrong and plan for it
- Test your programs with different inputs
- Make sure your conditions are clear and correct
