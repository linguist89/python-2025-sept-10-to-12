# Session 4: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice making decisions in your programs:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple age checker. How would you check if someone is old enough to vote (18 or older)?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's age and prints "You can vote!" if they're 18 or older, or "You cannot vote yet" if they're younger. Try it with different ages like 16, 18, and 25.

2. **Question:** You're building a simple weather app. How would you give different advice based on the temperature?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the temperature and gives advice:
   - If it's above 80°F: "It's hot! Stay hydrated."
   - If it's between 60-80°F: "Nice weather!"
   - If it's below 60°F: "It's cool, bring a jacket."

3. **Question:** You're making a simple grade calculator. How would you assign letter grades based on percentage scores?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that takes a percentage score and assigns:
   - 90% or above: A
   - 80-89%: B
   - 70-79%: C
   - 60-69%: D
   - Below 60%: F

4. **Question:** What's the difference between using `if`, `elif`, and `else`?

   **Self-Check:** Try writing the same program using only `if` statements, then rewrite it using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Which version is clearer and more efficient?

5. **Question:** You're making a simple password checker. How would you check if the password is correct?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for a password and checks if it matches "python123". If it's correct, print "Access granted!" If not, print "Access denied!" Try it with both the correct password and wrong passwords.
