# Session 2: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice working with variables and math:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple tip calculator. What variables would you need, and what math operations would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for the bill amount and tip percentage. Calculate the tip amount and total bill. Try it with different bill amounts like $25.50, $100.00, and $15.75.

2. **Question:** What happens when you try to do math with strings instead of numbers?

   **Self-Check:** Try this code and see what happens:
   ```python
   age = "25"  # This is text
   next_year = age + 1  # What happens here?
   ```
   Then fix it by converting the string to a number.

3. **Question:** You need to calculate the area of a rectangle. What variables and operations would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for length and width, then calculate the area. Try it with different rectangle sizes. What if the length is 5.5 and width is 3.2?

4. **Question:** What's the difference between regular division (`/`) and floor division (`//`)?

   **Self-Check:** Try dividing 10 by 3 using both operators:
   ```python
   result1 = 10 / 3
   result2 = 10 // 3
   print(result1, result2)
   ```
   What's the difference in the results?

5. **Question:** You're tracking how many cookies you have. You start with 12, eat 3, then buy 8 more. How would you use variables and operations to track this?

   **Self-Check:** Create a variable for your starting cookies, subtract the ones you ate, then add the ones you bought. Print the final count to make sure it's correct.
