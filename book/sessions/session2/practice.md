# Exercise 1: Create a simple calculator
num1 = 15
num2 = 4

# Calculate and print:
# - Sum
# - Difference  
# - Product
# - Quotient
# - Remainder

# Exercise 2: Work with strings
first = "Python"
second = "Programming"
third = "Course"

# Create a sentence using these variables

# Exercise 3: Temperature converter
# Convert 32Â°F to Celsius
# Formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9

::::{tip} Variable Reassignment
Remember: when you assign a new value to a variable, the old value is completely replaced. Python doesn't keep a history of previous values!
