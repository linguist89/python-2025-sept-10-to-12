# Real-World Problem: Simple Grade Calculator

## The Scenario

You're helping a teacher who wants to calculate student grades quickly. The teacher has been doing these calculations by hand, which takes a long time and sometimes leads to mistakes.

## The Challenge

The teacher needs to:
1. Calculate the average of test scores
2. Convert percentage grades to letter grades
3. Calculate final grades with different weights for different assignments

## Real-World Context

This is a common problem that teachers face every day:
- **Grading papers** - Calculating averages and final grades
- **Report cards** - Converting numbers to letter grades
- **Parent conferences** - Explaining how grades are calculated
- **Grade books** - Keeping track of student progress

## Sample Data

Let's work with this example:
- **Test scores**: 85, 92, 78, 96, 88
- **Assignment weights**: Tests count for 70%, homework counts for 30%
- **Homework average**: 90%

## What We Need to Build

We need to create simple functions that can:

1. **Calculate average** - Add up numbers and divide by how many there are
2. **Convert to letter grade** - Turn a percentage into A, B, C, D, or F
3. **Calculate weighted grade** - Combine different types of assignments with different weights

## Expected Results

- **Test average**: 87.8%
- **Letter grade for tests**: B
- **Final weighted grade**: 88.46%
- **Final letter grade**: B

## Why This Matters

Understanding how to break down problems into functions is important because:
- **Real problems are complex** - But they can be broken into simple pieces
- **Functions make work easier** - Write once, use many times
- **Functions prevent mistakes** - Do the calculation the same way every time
- **Functions are reusable** - Use the same functions for different students

## Next Steps

In the guided function creation section, we'll build these functions step by step, learning how to:
- Create simple functions that do one thing
- Use functions together to solve bigger problems
- Test our functions with real data
- Make our functions work for any student's grades
