# Session 1: Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice using variables:

1. **Question:** Create variables to store information about your favorite movie. What variables would you need, and what would you name them?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that creates variables for the movie title, year it was made, and your rating (1-10). Print them out to make sure they work correctly.

2. **Question:** You're making a simple shopping list program. What variables would you need to track items and their prices?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for at least 3 items and their prices. Use descriptive names that make it clear what each variable stores.

3. **Question:** Compare these two sets of variable names. Which is better and why?
   ```python
   # Version 1
   n = "John"
   a = 25
   
   # Version 2  
   name = "John"
   age = 25
   ```

   **Self-Check:** Write code using both versions and see which one is easier to understand. Try adding more variables to each version.

4. **Question:** You need to store someone's contact information. What different types of data would you need, and what data types would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for a person's name, phone number, and email address. Think about whether each should be a string, number, or boolean.

5. **Question:** What's the difference between storing a number as an integer (like `25`) versus a string (like `"25"`)?

   **Self-Check:** Create two variables - one storing `25` as a number and one storing `"25"` as text. Try adding `1` to each and see what happens. Which one can you do math with?
