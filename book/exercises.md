# Python Programming 2025 September 10 - 12

Welcome to your Python programming journey! This course is designed to take you from complete beginner to confident Python programmer through 6 focused sessions. Each session builds upon the previous one, so we recommend working through them in order.

## Course Overview

This course covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming through hands-on sessions and practical exercises. You'll learn by doing, with plenty of code examples and interactive exercises, all connected to real-world applications.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Write Python programs from scratch
- Use variables to store and manipulate data
- Get input from users and display output
- Make decisions in your programs with conditionals
- Repeat code efficiently with loops
- Create reusable code with functions
- Solve real-world problems with Python

## Course Structure

The course is divided into 6 progressive sessions:

1. **Session 1: Python Variables** - Learn the building blocks of programming
2. **Session 2: Working with Variables** - Master operations and data manipulation  
3. **Session 3: User Input and Output** - Make your programs interactive
4. **Session 4: Making Decisions** - Use conditionals to control program flow
5. **Session 5: Repeating Code** - Learn loops for efficient programming
6. **Session 6: Functions** - Create reusable code blocks

## How to Use This Course

Each session includes:
- **Learning Objectives** - What you'll accomplish
- **Clear Explanations** - Step-by-step concepts with examples
- **Code Examples** - Working Python code you can run
- **Practice Exercises** - Hands-on activities to reinforce learning
- **Quick Checks** - Test your understanding

## Getting Started

No prior programming experience is required! Just start with Session 1 and work your way through. Each session builds on the previous one, so take your time to understand each concept before moving on.
