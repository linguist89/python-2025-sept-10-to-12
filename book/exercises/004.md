# Session 4: Making Decisions with Conditionals

Now that you can get input from users and work with variables, let's learn how to make your programs make decisions! This is where programming gets really interesting.

::::::{topic} Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Compare values using comparison operators
- Create programs that make decisions
- Handle multiple conditions
- Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
::::::

## Basic If Statements

The `if` statement allows your program to make decisions based on conditions:

```python
# Simple if statement
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
```

## Comparison Operators

Python has several operators to compare values:

```python
# Comparison operators
x = 10
y = 5

print(x > y)   # Greater than: True
print(x < y)   # Less than: False
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal: True
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal: False
print(x == y)  # Equal to: False
print(x != y)  # Not equal to: True
```

## If-Else Statements

Use `else` to handle the case when the condition is false:

```python
# If-else statement
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You cannot vote yet.")
```

## If-Elif-Else Statements

Use `elif` (else if) to handle multiple conditions:

```python
# Multiple conditions
score = int(input("Enter your test score: "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

## Logical Operators

Combine conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`:

```python
# Logical operators
age = 25
has_license = True

# AND operator - both conditions must be true
if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive!")

# OR operator - at least one condition must be true
if age < 18 or not has_license:
    print("You cannot drive.")

# NOT operator - reverses the condition
if not has_license:
    print("You need a license to drive.")
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Temperature Checker

```python
# Temperature checker
temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in Celsius: "))

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot! Stay hydrated.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's warm and pleasant.")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("It's cool. You might need a jacket.")
else:
    print("It's cold! Bundle up.")
```

### Example 2: Password Checker

```python
# Simple password checker
correct_password = "python123"
user_password = input("Enter the password: ")

if user_password == correct_password:
    print("Access granted!")
else:
    print("Access denied!")
```

### Example 3: Number Classifier

```python
# Number classifier
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

# Check if even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```

## Nested If Statements

You can put if statements inside other if statements:

```python
# Nested conditions
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_license = input("Do you have a driver's license? (yes/no): ").lower()

if age >= 16:
    if has_license == "yes":
        print("You can drive!")
    else:
        print("You're old enough but need a license.")
else:
    print("You're too young to drive.")
```

## Practice Exercise

Create a program that determines what type of triangle you have based on three side lengths:

```python
# Triangle type checker
print("Triangle Type Checker")
print("=" * 20)

# Get side lengths
side1 = float(input("Enter length of side 1: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter length of side 2: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter length of side 3: "))

# Check if it's a valid triangle
if side1 + side2 > side3 and side2 + side3 > side1 and side1 + side3 > side2:
    print("This is a valid triangle!")
    
    # Determine triangle type
    if side1 == side2 == side3:
        print("Type: Equilateral (all sides equal)")
    elif side1 == side2 or side2 == side3 or side1 == side3:
        print("Type: Isosceles (two sides equal)")
    else:
        print("Type: Scalene (all sides different)")
else:
    print("This is not a valid triangle!")
```

## Advanced Example: Grade Calculator

```python
# Grade calculator with multiple criteria
print("Grade Calculator")
print("=" * 15)

# Get student information
name = input("Enter student name: ")
homework = float(input("Enter homework score (0-100): "))
midterm = float(input("Enter midterm score (0-100): "))
final = float(input("Enter final exam score (0-100): "))

# Calculate weighted average
# Homework: 30%, Midterm: 30%, Final: 40%
average = (homework * 0.3) + (midterm * 0.3) + (final * 0.4)

# Determine letter grade
if average >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif average >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif average >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif average >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Check for honors
if average >= 95:
    honors = " with High Honors"
elif average >= 90:
    honors = " with Honors"
else:
    honors = ""

# Display results
print(f"\nStudent: {name}")
print(f"Average: {average:.1f}")
print(f"Grade: {grade}{honors}")
```

::::{tip} Indentation Matters!
In Python, indentation (spaces or tabs) is crucial for if statements. All code that belongs to an if block must be indented the same amount. Use 4 spaces for indentation.

## Real-World Example: Why Making Decisions Matters

Imagine you're building a simple age verification system for a website. You need to check if someone is old enough to access certain content. This is a perfect example of using conditionals (if statements) to make decisions.

**The problem with not checking conditions:**
```python
# What if we don't check the age?
age = 15
print("Welcome to our website!")
# This would let anyone in, even kids who shouldn't be there
```

**Real example:** In 2018-2019, Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes had a software problem. The plane's computer was supposed to help prevent crashes, but it had a bug in its decision-making logic. When one sensor gave bad information, the computer made the wrong decision and caused the plane to crash, killing hundreds of people. This happened because the software didn't properly check all the conditions before making decisions.

**The programming lesson:**
This shows why it's important to:
- Always check all the conditions before making decisions
- Have backup plans when things go wrong
- Test your decision-making logic thoroughly
- Make sure your conditions cover all possible situations

**Key takeaways:**
- Always use if statements to check conditions before acting
- Think about what could go wrong and plan for it
- Test your programs with different inputs
- Make sure your conditions are clear and correct

## Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice making decisions in your programs:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple age checker. How would you check if someone is old enough to vote (18 or older)?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's age and prints "You can vote!" if they're 18 or older, or "You cannot vote yet" if they're younger. Try it with different ages like 16, 18, and 25.

2. **Question:** You're building a simple weather app. How would you give different advice based on the temperature?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the temperature and gives advice:
   - If it's above 80°F: "It's hot! Stay hydrated."
   - If it's between 60-80°F: "Nice weather!"
   - If it's below 60°F: "It's cool, bring a jacket."

3. **Question:** You're making a simple grade calculator. How would you assign letter grades based on percentage scores?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that takes a percentage score and assigns:
   - 90% or above: A
   - 80-89%: B
   - 70-79%: C
   - 60-69%: D
   - Below 60%: F

4. **Question:** What's the difference between using `if`, `elif`, and `else`?

   **Self-Check:** Try writing the same program using only `if` statements, then rewrite it using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Which version is clearer and more efficient?

5. **Question:** You're making a simple password checker. How would you check if the password is correct?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for a password and checks if it matches "python123". If it's correct, print "Access granted!" If not, print "Access denied!" Try it with both the correct password and wrong passwords.
