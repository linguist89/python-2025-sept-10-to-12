## Mathematical Operations with Variables

You can perform mathematical operations using variables just like you would with numbers:

```python
# Basic arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 3

# Addition
sum_result = a + b
print(sum_result)  # Output: 13

# Subtraction
difference = a - b
print(difference)  # Output: 7

# Multiplication
product = a * b
print(product)     # Output: 30

# Division
quotient = a / b
print(quotient)    # Output: 3.3333333333333335

# Floor division (whole number division)
floor_quotient = a // b
print(floor_quotient)  # Output: 3

# Modulus (remainder)
remainder = a % b
print(remainder)   # Output: 1

# Exponentiation (power)
power = a ** b
print(power)       # Output: 1000
```

## String Operations

Strings can be combined and manipulated in various ways:

```python
# String concatenation (joining strings)
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe

# String repetition
greeting = "Hello! "
repeated_greeting = greeting * 3
print(repeated_greeting)  # Output: Hello! Hello! Hello!

# String length
name_length = len(full_name)
print(name_length)  # Output: 8
```

## Updating Variable Values

Variables can be updated by assigning new values to them:

```python
# Initial value
count = 5
print("Initial count:", count)

# Update the value
count = count + 1  # This is the same as count += 1
print("After adding 1:", count)

# Shortcut operators
count += 2  # Same as count = count + 2
print("After adding 2:", count)

count -= 1  # Same as count = count - 1
print("After subtracting 1:", count)

count *= 2  # Same as count = count * 2
print("After multiplying by 2:", count)
```

## Variables in Expressions

You can use variables in complex expressions:

```python
# Calculate the area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width
print(f"The area is {area} square units")

# Calculate a percentage
total_points = 100
earned_points = 85
percentage = (earned_points / total_points) * 100
print(f"You scored {percentage}%")

# Temperature conversion
celsius = 25
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print(f"{celsius}°C is {fahrenheit}°F")
```

## Type Conversion

Sometimes you need to convert between different data types:

```python
# Converting numbers to strings
age = 25
age_string = str(age)
print("I am " + age_string + " years old")

# Converting strings to numbers
user_input = "42"
number = int(user_input)
doubled = number * 2
print(f"Double of {number} is {doubled}")

# Converting to float
price_string = "19.99"
price = float(price_string)
tax = price * 0.08
print(f"Tax on ${price} is ${tax:.2f}")
```

## Practice Exercise

Try these exercises to practice working with variables:

```python
# Exercise 1: Create a simple calculator
num1 = 15
num2 = 4

# Calculate and print:
# - Sum
# - Difference  
# - Product
# - Quotient
# - Remainder

# Exercise 2: Work with strings
first = "Python"
second = "Programming"
third = "Course"

# Create a sentence using these variables
# Hint: Use string concatenation

# Exercise 3: Temperature converter
# Convert 32°F to Celsius
# Formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9

# Exercise 4: Shopping cart
item_price = 29.99
quantity = 3
tax_rate = 0.08

# Calculate:
# - Subtotal
# - Tax amount
# - Total cost
```

::::{tip} Variable Reassignment
Remember: when you assign a new value to a variable, the old value is completely replaced. Python doesn't keep a history of previous values!
::::

::::{card} Quick Check
What will be the output of this code?
```python
x = 5
y = 2
result = x ** y + x * y
print(result)
```

::::{card} Quick Check
Which operation will give you the remainder when dividing 17 by 5?
- `17 / 5`
- `17 // 5`
- `17 % 5`
- `17 ** 5`

## Real-World Example: Why Math Operations Matter

Imagine you're building a simple calculator app. You need to add two numbers that the user enters. This seems simple, but there are important things to consider:

**The problem with different data types:**
```python
# This works fine
price = 19.99
tax = 1.60
total = price + tax
print(total)  # Output: 21.59

# But what if we mix data types incorrectly?
price = "19.99"  # This is text, not a number!
tax = 1.60
total = price + tax  # ERROR! Can't add text and numbers
```

**Real example:** In 1996, a European rocket called Ariane 5 exploded just 37 seconds after launch, costing $370 million! The problem was that the rocket's computer tried to do math with numbers that were too big for the type of variable it was using. It's like trying to fit a gallon of water into a shot glass - it overflows and causes problems.

**The programming lesson:**
This shows why it's important to:
- Use the right data type for your numbers
- Test your math operations with different values
- Make sure your variables can handle the numbers you're working with

**Key takeaways:**
- Always check that your variables can hold the values you need
- Test your math with different numbers to make sure it works
- Be careful when mixing different types of data

## Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice working with variables and math:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple tip calculator. What variables would you need, and what math operations would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for the bill amount and tip percentage. Calculate the tip amount and total bill. Try it with different bill amounts like $25.50, $100.00, and $15.75.

2. **Question:** What happens when you try to do math with strings instead of numbers?

   **Self-Check:** Try this code and see what happens:
   ```python
   age = "25"  # This is text
   next_year = age + 1  # What happens here?
   ```
   Then fix it by converting the string to a number.

3. **Question:** You need to calculate the area of a rectangle. What variables and operations would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for length and width, then calculate the area. Try it with different rectangle sizes. What if the length is 5.5 and width is 3.2?

4. **Question:** What's the difference between regular division (`/`) and floor division (`//`)?

   **Self-Check:** Try dividing 10 by 3 using both operators:
   ```python
   result1 = 10 / 3
   result2 = 10 // 3
   print(result1, result2)
   ```
   What's the difference in the results?

5. **Question:** You're tracking how many cookies you have. You start with 12, eat 3, then buy 8 more. How would you use variables and operations to track this?

   **Self-Check:** Create a variable for your starting cookies, subtract the ones you ate, then add the ones you bought. Print the final count to make sure it's correct.
