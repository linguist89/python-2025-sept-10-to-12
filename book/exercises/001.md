# Session 1: Python Variables - The Building Blocks

Welcome to your first Python programming session! In this session, you'll learn about variables - the fundamental building blocks that allow you to store and work with data in Python.

::::::{topic} Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Understand what variables are and why they're important
- Create and assign values to variables
- Use different data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Print variables and their values
- Follow Python naming conventions
::::::

## What are Variables?

A **variable** is like a labeled box that can hold different types of information. Think of it as a container with a name tag that you can put things into and take things out of.

In Python, you create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the `=` sign.

```python
# Creating a variable
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

## Basic Variable Types

Python has several built-in data types. Let's explore the most common ones:

### 1. Strings (Text)
Strings are used to store text. They are enclosed in quotes.

```python
# String variables
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
message = "Hello, World!"
```

### 2. Numbers
Python can handle different types of numbers:

```python
# Integer (whole numbers)
age = 25
count = 100

# Float (decimal numbers)
height = 5.9
temperature = 98.6
```

### 3. Booleans
Booleans represent True or False values:

```python
# Boolean variables
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
has_license = True
```

## Printing Variables

To see what's stored in a variable, you can use the `print()` function:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name)        # Output: Alice
print(age)         # Output: 25
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old")
```

## Variable Naming Rules

Python has specific rules for naming variables:

1. **Start with a letter or underscore** (not a number)
2. **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores**
3. **Case sensitive** (age ≠ Age ≠ AGE)
4. **Cannot use Python keywords** (like `print`, `if`, `for`, etc.)

```python
# Good variable names
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 25
is_logged_in = True
_private_var = "secret"

# Bad variable names (these will cause errors)
# 2name = "Alice"     # Can't start with number
# user-name = "Alice"  # Can't use hyphens
# print = "Hello"      # Can't use Python keywords
```

::::{tip} Naming Convention
Use **snake_case** for variable names in Python: separate words with underscores and use lowercase letters. This makes your code more readable!

## Practice Exercise

Try creating and printing some variables yourself! Use the code cell below to practice:

```python
# Your turn! Create some variables below:

# 1. Create a variable for your name
my_name = "Your Name Here"

# 2. Create a variable for your age
my_age = 0

# 3. Create a variable for your favorite color
favorite_color = "Your Color Here"

# 4. Print all three variables
print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("Favorite color:", favorite_color)

# 5. Create a sentence using your variables
print(f"Hi! I'm {my_name}, I'm {my_age} years old, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}.")
```

## Guided Questions - Step by Step

Work through these questions step by step. Each question will guide you through the thinking process and show you exactly how to solve it.

### Question 1: Creating Your First Variable
**Problem:** Create a variable called `my_name` and assign your name to it, then print it.

**Step 1:** Think about what you need
- You need a variable name: `my_name`
- You need to assign a value (your name in quotes)
- You need to print the variable

**Step 2:** Write the code
```python
my_name = "Your Name Here"
print(my_name)
```

**Step 3:** Test it
Run the code and make sure it prints your name correctly.

### Question 2: Different Data Types
**Problem:** Create variables for your age (as a number), your height (as a decimal), and whether you like Python (as True/False).

**Step 1:** Identify the data types
- Age: integer (whole number)
- Height: float (decimal number)  
- Like Python: boolean (True or False)

**Step 2:** Write the code
```python
age = 25
height = 5.6
likes_python = True
```

**Step 3:** Print them to verify
```python
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Likes Python:", likes_python)
```

```

**Step 2:** Combine them
```python
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full name:", full_name)
```

### Question 10: Variable Types Check
**Problem:** Create variables of different types and use the `type()` function to check their types.

**Step 1:** Create different types
```python
name = "Python"
age = 30
height = 5.9
is_programming = True
```

**Step 2:** Check their types
```python

**Step 1:** Create the constant (uppercase name)
```python
PI = 3.14159
radius = 5
```

**Step 2:** Calculate the area
```python
area = PI * radius * radius
print(f"Area of circle: {area}")
```

### Question 13: Variable Naming Rules

# user-name = "Alice"  # Can't use hyphens
# print = "Hello"      # Can't use Python keywords
```

### Question 14: Variable Initialization
**Problem:** Create variables and initialize them with default values.

**Step 1:** Initialize with defaults
```python
score = 0
player_name = ""
game_over = False
```

**Step 2:** Update the values
```python
score = 100

## Real-World Example: Why Variable Names Matter

Imagine you're working on a simple calculator app. You need to store two numbers that the user enters. Look at these two examples:

**Bad variable names:**
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x + y
```

**Good variable names:**
```python
first_number = 10
second_number = 5
sum_result = first_number + second_number
```

**Why this matters:**
When you come back to your code later (or when someone else reads it), the second version is much clearer! You can immediately see that you're adding two numbers together. The first version could be doing anything - maybe it's coordinates, maybe it's prices, maybe it's ages. Good variable names make your code self-documenting.

**Real example:** In 1999, NASA lost a $327 million Mars spacecraft because of confusing variable names. The software used variables that weren't clear about what units they contained (metric vs imperial), leading to a navigation error that destroyed the spacecraft.

**Key takeaways:**
- Use descriptive names that explain what the variable contains
- Avoid single letters like `x`, `y`, `z` unless it's obvious what they mean
- Make your code readable for others (and yourself in the future!)

## Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice using variables:

1. **Question:** Create variables to store information about your favorite movie. What variables would you need, and what would you name them?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that creates variables for the movie title, year it was made, and your rating (1-10). Print them out to make sure they work correctly.

2. **Question:** You're making a simple shopping list program. What variables would you need to track items and their prices?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for at least 3 items and their prices. Use descriptive names that make it clear what each variable stores.

3. **Question:** Compare these two sets of variable names. Which is better and why?
   ```python
   # Version 1
   n = "John"
   a = 25
   
   # Version 2  
   name = "John"
   age = 25
   ```

   **Self-Check:** Write code using both versions and see which one is easier to understand. Try adding more variables to each version.

4. **Question:** You need to store someone's contact information. What different types of data would you need, and what data types would you use?

   **Self-Check:** Create variables for a person's name, phone number, and email address. Think about whether each should be a string, number, or boolean.

5. **Question:** What's the difference between storing a number as an integer (like `25`) versus a string (like `"25"`)?

   **Self-Check:** Create two variables - one storing `25` as a number and one storing `"25"` as text. Try adding `1` to each and see what happens. Which one can you do math with?
