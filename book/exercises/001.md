# Lesson 1: Python Variables - The Building Blocks

Welcome to your first Python programming lesson! In this lesson, you'll learn about variables - the fundamental building blocks that allow you to store and work with data in Python.

::::::{topic} Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand what variables are and why they're important
- Create and assign values to variables
- Use different data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Print variables and their values
- Follow Python naming conventions
::::::

## What are Variables?

A **variable** is like a labeled box that can hold different types of information. Think of it as a container with a name tag that you can put things into and take things out of.

In Python, you create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the `=` sign.

```python
# Creating a variable
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

## Basic Variable Types

Python has several built-in data types. Let's explore the most common ones:

### 1. Strings (Text)
Strings are used to store text. They are enclosed in quotes.

```python
# String variables
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
message = "Hello, World!"
```

### 2. Numbers
Python can handle different types of numbers:

```python
# Integer (whole numbers)
age = 25
count = 100

# Float (decimal numbers)
height = 5.9
temperature = 98.6
```

### 3. Booleans
Booleans represent True or False values:

```python
# Boolean variables
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
has_license = True
```

## Printing Variables

To see what's stored in a variable, you can use the `print()` function:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name)        # Output: Alice
print(age)         # Output: 25
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old")
```

## Variable Naming Rules

Python has specific rules for naming variables:

1. **Start with a letter or underscore** (not a number)
2. **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores**
3. **Case sensitive** (age ≠ Age ≠ AGE)
4. **Cannot use Python keywords** (like `print`, `if`, `for`, etc.)

```python
# Good variable names
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 25
is_logged_in = True
_private_var = "secret"

# Bad variable names (these will cause errors)
# 2name = "Alice"     # Can't start with number
# user-name = "Alice"  # Can't use hyphens
# print = "Hello"      # Can't use Python keywords
```

::::{tip} Naming Convention
Use **snake_case** for variable names in Python: separate words with underscores and use lowercase letters. This makes your code more readable!

## Practice Exercise

Try creating and printing some variables yourself! Use the code cell below to practice:

```python
# Your turn! Create some variables below:

# 1. Create a variable for your name
my_name = "Your Name Here"

# 2. Create a variable for your age
my_age = 0

# 3. Create a variable for your favorite color
favorite_color = "Your Color Here"

# 4. Print all three variables
print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("Favorite color:", favorite_color)

# 5. Create a sentence using your variables
print(f"Hi! I'm {my_name}, I'm {my_age} years old, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}.")
```

::::{card} Quick Check
What will be the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x + y
print(result)
```

::::{card} Quick Check
Which of these are valid variable names in Python?
- `my_variable`
- `2nd_place`
- `user_name`
- `total-count`
- `_private`
