# Session 3: User Input and Output

Great job on learning about variables! Now let's learn how to make your Python programs interactive by getting input from users and displaying output in different ways.

::::::{topic} Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Get input from users using the `input()` function
- Display output using different methods
- Format strings for better output
- Handle different types of user input
- Create interactive programs
::::::

## Getting User Input

The `input()` function allows your program to get text from the user:

```python
# Basic input
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Input with a number
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are " + age + " years old")
```

## Important: Input Always Returns Strings

The `input()` function always returns a string, even if the user types a number:

```python
# This will cause an error!
age = input("Enter your age: ")
next_year = age + 1  # ERROR! Can't add string and number
print("Next year you'll be", next_year)
```

To fix this, you need to convert the string to a number:

```python
# Correct way to handle numeric input
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)  # Convert string to integer
next_year = age + 1
print("Next year you'll be", next_year)

# Or do it in one line
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
next_year = age + 1
print("Next year you'll be", next_year)
```

## Different Ways to Display Output

### 1. Basic Print Statements

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# Multiple arguments (automatically separated by spaces)
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

# Using commas
print("Hello", name, "you are", age, "years old")
```

### 2. String Formatting with f-strings

F-strings (formatted string literals) are the modern way to format strings in Python:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6

# f-string formatting
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old")
print(f"Your height is {height} feet")

# Formatting numbers
price = 19.99
print(f"The price is ${price:.2f}")  # Shows 2 decimal places
```

### 3. String Concatenation

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# String concatenation
message = "Hello " + name + ", you are " + str(age) + " years old"
print(message)
```

## Creating Interactive Programs

Let's create a simple interactive program:

```python
# Interactive greeting program
print("Welcome to our Python program!")
print("=" * 30)

# Get user information
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
favorite_color = input("What's your favorite color? ")

# Display personalized message
print(f"\nNice to meet you, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Your favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

# Calculate something
birth_year = 2024 - age
print(f"You were probably born in {birth_year}.")
```

## Handling Different Input Types

```python
# Getting a number
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
doubled = number * 2
print(f"Double of {number} is {doubled}")

# Getting a decimal number
price = float(input("Enter a price: "))
tax = price * 0.08
total = price + tax
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")
print(f"Tax: ${tax:.2f}")
print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")

# Getting a boolean-like input
response = input("Do you like Python? (yes/no): ")
if response.lower() == "yes":
    print("Great! Python is awesome!")
else:
    print("Maybe you'll change your mind after this course!")
```

## Practice Exercise

Create an interactive program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle:

```python
# Rectangle Calculator
print("Rectangle Calculator")
print("=" * 20)

# Get dimensions from user
length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width: "))

# Calculate area and perimeter
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display results
print(f"\nResults:")
print(f"Length: {length}")
print(f"Width: {width}")
print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

## Advanced String Formatting

```python
# Different ways to format numbers
number = 3.14159

print(f"Default: {number}")
print(f"2 decimal places: {number:.2f}")
print(f"4 decimal places: {number:.4f}")
print(f"Percentage: {number:.1%}")
print(f"Scientific notation: {number:.2e}")

# Formatting with alignment
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"Name: {name:<10} Age: {age:>3}")
print(f"Name: {name:>10} Age: {age:<3}")
```

::::{tip} Input Validation
In real programs, you should always check if the user input is valid before using it. For now, we'll assume users enter valid input, but later you'll learn about error handling!

## Real-World Example: Why Input Validation Matters

Imagine you're building a simple age calculator. You ask the user for their birth year and calculate their age. This seems simple, but what if the user types something unexpected?

**The problem with bad input:**
```python
# What if the user types "abc" instead of a number?
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")
age = 2024 - birth_year  # ERROR! Can't subtract text from a number
```

**Real example:** In the 1980s, a medical machine called Therac-25 was used to treat cancer patients with radiation. The machine's software didn't properly check the input from doctors. When doctors typed commands too quickly, the machine sometimes gave patients 100 times more radiation than intended, causing serious injuries. This happened because the software didn't validate the input properly.

**The programming lesson:**
This shows why it's important to:
- Always check what the user types before using it
- Give clear instructions to users
- Handle unexpected input gracefully
- Test your programs with different types of input

**Key takeaways:**
- Always validate user input before using it
- Give users clear instructions about what to type
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Test your programs with different inputs

## Open-Ended Practice Questions

Try these simple exercises to practice getting input from users:

1. **Question:** You're making a simple greeting program. How would you get the user's name and say hello to them?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's name and then prints a personalized greeting. Try running it and entering different names to make sure it works.

2. **Question:** What happens when you try to do math with user input without converting it to a number?

   **Self-Check:** Try this code:
   ```python
   age = input("Enter your age: ")
   next_year = age + 1
   print(f"Next year you'll be {next_year}")
   ```
   What happens? How would you fix it?

3. **Question:** You're making a simple calculator. How would you get two numbers from the user and add them together?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for two numbers, converts them to integers, adds them, and prints the result. Try it with different numbers to make sure it works.

4. **Question:** How would you make your program more user-friendly by giving clear instructions?

   **Self-Check:** Compare these two prompts:
   ```python
   # Version 1
   name = input("Name: ")
   
   # Version 2
   name = input("Please enter your full name: ")
   ```
   Which one is clearer? Try both and see which gives better results.

5. **Question:** You're making a simple survey. How would you ask for someone's favorite color and then use that information?

   **Self-Check:** Write code that asks for the user's favorite color and then prints a message like "Your favorite color is blue!" Try it with different colors to make sure it works correctly.
