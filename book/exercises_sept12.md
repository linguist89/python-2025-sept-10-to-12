# Object-Oriented Programming with Classes

Welcome to the third day of our Python programming course! Today we'll explore **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using classes - a powerful paradigm that allows us to model real-world entities and create organized, reusable code.

## What You'll Learn Today

By the end of today's sessions, you will be able to:

- **Understand object-oriented programming** - Learn what classes and objects are and why they're essential
- **Create your first classes** - Write classes with attributes and methods to model real-world entities
- **Master different method types** - Use instance methods, class methods, and static methods effectively
- **Apply inheritance** - Create class hierarchies and understand polymorphism
- **Design class interfaces** - Create classes that are intuitive and easy to use
- **Build complex systems** - Combine multiple classes to solve real-world problems

## Real-World Focus

Today's content is designed around **real-world modeling** that you might encounter in:

- **Software Development** - Building applications with organized, maintainable code
- **Data Modeling** - Representing real-world entities in your programs
- **System Design** - Creating scalable and extensible software architectures
- **Game Development** - Modeling characters, items, and game mechanics
- **Business Applications** - Building systems that mirror real business processes

## Learning Approach

Each session follows a structured approach:

1. **Lesson** - Core concepts and theory with real-world analogies
2. **Practice Classes** - Hands-on exercises requiring class creation and implementation
3. **Progressive Complexity** - Building from simple classes to complex inheritance hierarchies

## Prerequisites

Before starting today's content, make sure you're comfortable with:
- Variables and data types
- Functions and parameters
- Basic programming concepts from previous sessions
- Problem-solving with code

## Course Structure

Today's sessions build progressively:

1. **Session 10: Introduction to Classes** - Learn the basics of classes and objects
2. **Session 11: Class Methods and Attributes** - Master different types of methods and attributes
3. **Session 12: Inheritance and Advanced Concepts** - Build class hierarchies and understand polymorphism

Ready to think in objects and build powerful, organized programs? Let's start creating classes that model the real world!
